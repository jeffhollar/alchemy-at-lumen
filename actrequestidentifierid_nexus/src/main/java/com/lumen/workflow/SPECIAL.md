### Initialize environment

In a separate terminal window

#### Create caller and target namespaces

```
ssh loneronin@192.168.1.233

temporal operator namespace create --namespace nexus-lumen-act-ns
# temporal operator namespace create --namespace nexus-ai-agent-caller-ns
###
tctl namespace list
```

## Make Sure Worker is running 
The build is now successful. The JAR file should be created in the build/libs directory. You can run it with:

```
java -jar build/libs/actrequest.jar config/temporal.properties
```

## In new terminal run the client to start a workflow 
The build is now successful. The JAR file should be created in the build/libs directory. You can run it with:

```
java -cp build/libs/actrequest.jar com.lumen.workflow.client.ActClient config/temporal.properties
```

Here's a summary of what we've done:
1. Organized the code into logical packages:
* options - Client configuration
* service - Activity service
* workflow - Workflow implementation
* worker - Worker implementation
* model - Data models
2. Fixed the SSL context handling in ClientOptions to use the correct Netty SSL types
3. Added proper error handling and logging throughout the codebase
4. Created a fat JAR that includes all dependencies

The workflow is now ready to:
1. Connect to a Temporal server with optional SSL/TLS or API key authentication
2. Process ActRequest objects through a workflow
3.  Return ActResponse objects
4. Handle errors gracefully
Would you like me to explain any part of the implementation in more detail or make any modifications?

The Nexus service will be available at:
Endpoint: http://localhost:8080/actrequestidentifierid/processAct
Namespace: nexus-lumen-act-ns
Task Queue: act-task-queue
The service will expose an OpenAPI documentation at http://localhost:8080/openapi.json which you can use to understand the API structure and generate client code.
